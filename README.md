# Pure JS Accessibility Goodies
Pure JS Accessibility Goodies is a collection of small code samples that I find useful and that I'm probably going to use sometime in the future. Some things in this repo will be written by me, other will not. Every example is 100% dependancy free. No jQuery or anything else.

Feel free to use code you find here in your own projects. Please report any issues you find!
