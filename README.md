# Pure JS Accessibility Goodies
Pure JS Accessibility Goodies is a collection of small code samples that I find useful and that I'm probably going to use sometime in the future. Some things in this repo will be written by me, other will not.

Feel free to use code you find here in your own projects. Please report any issues you find!
